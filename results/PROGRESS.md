## 2026-09-30 — I-011 corrected, and why the correction is on record

`mosaic_branch_target` now takes `is_branch`, `is_jal`, `is_jalr` and
`branch_taken`, and computes

```
is_taken = is_jal | is_jalr | (is_branch & branch_taken)
```

with `funct3` appearing only inside `mosaic_branch_cmp`, which is the one unit
that needs to know the encoding exists. `CASE=alu.boundaries` passes with 108560
ALU and 49536 branch vectors, 316022 checks, zero failures; all nine mutants still
fail.

The property that makes this worth having is tested rather than asserted: a
caller that drives `branch_taken` high while naming no branch gets
`is_taken = 0`, and the testbench both checks that invariant and asserts the
stimulus actually reached the case. A design that fails loudly is only useful if
something is watching for the failure.

**What happened here, recorded because the process matters more than the
outcome.** My first port list omitted `is_jal`, which made an unconditional `JAL`
indistinguishable from a not-taken branch. The agent solved that by treating
funct3 `010`/`011` — two reserved encodings no RV64I branch uses — as "names no
condition, therefore taken". I rejected it. It is harmless today and silently
wrong the day an instruction collides with the pattern, and the failure would
land only on instructions nobody was looking at. The honest description is that
**my port list was under-specified, not that the agent implemented it wrongly**,
and that is what the report says.
