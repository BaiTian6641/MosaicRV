"""Negative controls for CASE=fabric.integrated (work package I-090).

The case claims three things: the fixed and dynamic configurations of one core
retire the same architecture; the dynamic configuration demonstrably does
something the fixed one does not; and the fabric leaves the machine's invariants
intact. A claim like that is evidence only if the defect it excludes would be
caught, so this tool rebuilds the case from an empty directory with exactly one
defect injected through a `-DMOSAIC_*` define and runs it. Every mutant must:

  * build cleanly into its own directory, with its `-D` on the recorded command
    line (`build_command.txt` next to the binary);
  * produce a binary that differs from the shipping one (`cmp`), so a stale
    build cannot masquerade as a mutant;
  * exit 1, with the named check the mutation breaks present in the output.

A mutant that exits 0 is either an unobservable defect or a check that cannot
fail; this tool reports it as NOT MET rather than counting it.

The shipping build is built and run first, from an empty directory: mutants mean
nothing if the case does not pass in the first place.
