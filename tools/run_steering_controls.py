"""Negative controls for CASE=steering.capacity_locality (work package I-029).

The case claims three things about the dynamic steering policy: a unit that
cannot execute a macro's class never receives it; saturation stalls or retries a
macro and never changes its architectural result; and the whole decision is a
deterministic function of the program's state, so the fixed-affinity and
dynamic-steering runs of one program are comparable. A claim like that is
evidence only if the defect it excludes would be caught, so this tool rebuilds
the case with exactly one defect injected through a `-DMOSAIC_STEER_MUTANT_*`
define -- from an empty build directory, so a mutant can never reuse the
shipping object files -- and runs it. Every mutant must:

  * build cleanly into its own directory, with its `-D` on the recorded command
    line (`build_command.txt` next to the binary);
  * produce a binary that differs from the shipping one (`cmp`), so a stale
    build cannot masquerade as a mutant;
  * exit 1, with the named check the mutation breaks as the first failure.

A mutant that exits 0 is either an unobservable defect or a check that cannot
fail; this tool reports it as NOT MET rather than counting it.

The shipping build is built and run first, from an empty directory: mutants mean
nothing if the case does not pass in the first place.
